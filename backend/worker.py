"""
arq Worker Settings
--------------------
Defines the background job queue worker. Runs as a separate process from
the FastAPI app (see docker-compose.yml `worker` service), so uploads
survive API server restarts/redeploys — the job lives in Redis until a
worker picks it up, not in the API process's memory.
